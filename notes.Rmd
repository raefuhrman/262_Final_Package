Potential threshold for tree death with certain levels of fog, tmax, and precipitation. Insert parameters for the species and models whether it meets that requirement. IF tmax is over a certain threshold for a certain number of days, precip below threshold, fog below threshold. 
summary functions -- temp average, precip sum. etc.
