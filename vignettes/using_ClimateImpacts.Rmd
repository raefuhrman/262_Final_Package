This example illustrates the use of the function plant_growth using the imaginary sunshine_hours data

```{r example_plantgrowth}

#get sunshine_hours data.  This represents (imaginary) average daily hours of sunshine for a given month between 2001 and 2006, for three different locations.  It is a multidimension array (12 months as columns, 6 years as rows, and 3 locations in the 3rd dimension)
data(sunshine_hours)

#If you want to use the standard data in multidimensional array format, you can simply run the function.  This gives the (imaginary) growth in mm of a plant in that month.

plant_growth_result <- plant_growth()
plant_growth_result

#This should give the same results as plant_growth_mda, which was created by applying the plant_growth function to the sunshine_hours multidimensional array.
data(plant_growth_mda)
plant_growth_mda

#You could also run the function with other data in other formats, such as a single vector.  For instance:

madeup_vector <- c(3,4,8,23)
madeup_example <- plant_growth(madeup_vector)
madeup_example

```

```{r example_plantrevenue}



```
